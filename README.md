Welcome to the source repository of the Minecraft modification **Painted Glowstone**.

It adds **Painted glowstone** blocks to the game - and so, as the name says, some glowstone blocks that can be painted with other textures. Create a **Painting roller** item and some **Painted glowstone** blocks to start with it.

## Dependencies
Requires **LibX** ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/libx), [GitHub](https://github.com/ModdingX/LibX)), Version 4.2.5

## Crafting recipes

## How to paint the block?
Take your "Painting roller" into your main hand and right-click any block you want while you are sneaking. The block is copied to the painting roll.
Next, right-click a "Painted glowstone" block with your roller. It now mimics the copied block.

## Modpack
You can use this mod in every modpack that is available for free. You are allowed to distribute the mod file in an own ModPack launcher.
If the modpack is not distributed via CurseForge, you need to add a link to this repository, [my website](https://berger-media.biz/downloads/11/minecraft/painted-glowstone) or the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/painted-glowstone) of this modification.
